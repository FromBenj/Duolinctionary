### _Side project to get Duolingo words that I have learnt_

## What it is
When you are using the Duolingo App, you can't download the words you have learnt.

So I decided to create a small Symfony (skeleton) app to create a formatted Microsoft Word file from the raw HTML dictionary file of Duolingo.

```
I am now trying to directly host the file online, so that learners can easily access to their words from their phone.
