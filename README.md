### _Side project to get Duolingo words that I have learnt_

## What it is
When you are using the Duolingo App, you can't download the words you have learnt.

So I decided to create a small Symfony (skeleton) app to create a formatted Microsoft Word file from the raw HTML dictionary file of Duolingo.

The created file is also sent to a Dropbox folder, so that you can check it whenever and wherever you want.
